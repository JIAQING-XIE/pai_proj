This task is generally handled by Gaussian process (GP) regressors using Sklearn. The prediction GP model combines a matern kernel and a white noise kernel. The constraint GP model combines a matern, a white noise, and a constant kernel. In each of the two models, the parameters are fixed by what is described in the manual. We have implemented the following functions: 1) the next recommendation. It was found that two fixed point warmups (1/4 quartile & 3/4 quartile) were more effective than one random point warmup. Thus, we recommended one of these two points inside the domain to the optimizer, and after the warmup, we recommended the best point based on the acquisition function. 2) the acquisition function. Our acquisition function for this task was expected improvement (EI) of the prediction model, under the scheme of the task topic Bayesian Optimization. The CDF of the constraint model prediction was also calculated. The overall acquisition function is a function of EI and cdf(v), for example, EI - a * cdf(v), where we set a to 200 in practice, and v is a parameter of predicted mean and standard deviation. 3) add_data_point. We concatenated the given input x, v, f to their corresponding previous trained vectors, retrained two GP models once we add these new points (40 times for each problem). We analyzed whether the 1/4 quartile initialization is good or not in terms of the lower bound of v and f. Generally, we recommend the 3/4 quartile if the 1/4 quartile is a good point. 4) get_solution. We would prefer the point that satisfies both conditions: trying to be the maximum of f and standing above v_min, which is 1.2. The solution has been tested on different computing platforms. Based on our final tests, the best regret score is around 0.15/0.16 with a good seed such as 2 or 20.
